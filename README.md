# Differentiable Neural Computer

TensorFlow 2 implementation of a Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) with LSTM controller as defined in [Hybrid computing using a neural network with dynamic external memory](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20101).

Install by cloning the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:arnaudvl/differentiable-neural-computer.git
```

Dependencies:
```bash
numpy
tensorflow>=2
```

The [example notebook](https://github.com/arnaudvl/differentiable-neural-computer/blob/master/example.ipynb) illustrates how to train the DNC, defined in [model.py](https://github.com/arnaudvl/differentiable-neural-computer/blob/master/model.py).
